            <p class="paragraph">
                Through this course I practice ingenuity and diligence. The course had shaped me to be a curious learner. This course has very much contributed to my decision to take computer science. Solving the Problem sets in this course makes me get a great sense of satisfaction after completion. <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/">CS50</a> has been very meaningful and it exposed me to the university lifestyle similar to polytechnic’s where lectures are given .

                I completed the course in the span of 4 months from December to March (2022). My progress in the course has  been fast in the earlier weeks but soon the difficulty of the course increased as weeks passed resulting in me taking a longer duration to complete it. The course taught me to program in VScode with a ubuntu terminal. Having only discovered linux not long before I took the course, the environment was not forein but my lack of experience slowed me. However the course gave me a chance to practice and now i find it more natural using linux. The programming aspect of the course is generously taught. At times when I face a difficulty I would consult my cousin who would guide me and explain confusing parts.

        <li class="course">The Python Bible™ | Everything You Need to Program in Python</li>
            <img class="center-img" src="../assets/course/pythoncourse.png">
            <p class="paragraph">
                This course kick started my journey in programming. <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-python-bible/">The Python Bible</a> is really a mildly challenging course for absolute beginners. I expected programming to be hard and complicated, however when I took up this course, it was easier than expected. From this course I learnt the very basics of programming which proved itself helpful when I was taking CS50. My main take away from this course is the confidence it gave me to continue programming other than the python syntax. This course also helped me understand some of my friends who were also learning python at that time. I got to chat about python related topics with them.

            <img class="center-img" src="../assets/course/cyber_sec.png">
            <p class="paragraph">
                I attended this course to help me understand more about cybersecurity. This course covered the basics of computing, networking, Basic cyber attack and defence. This course made me want to find out more about cybersecurity. Having attended this course I am intrigued to pursue cybersecurity. The course instructor is a youtuber whose videos I regularly watch and is also a cybersecurity graduate from Southeast Missouri State University.
