                    I have been in the Media Resource Club for 4 years. The CCA taught me how to operate the school PA system, set-up projectors, set-up mic and speaker and photography. Every member of the club has to help the school in events and flag raising, we are like the backbone of events. I was appointed the logistic IC in secondary 3. I had to consolidate and keep track of the equipment we have. Being the logistic IC made me exercise responsibility.

                I mostly spend my free time on Youtube watching Tech channels. I enjoy watching these youtubers build computers and give tech tips. I also stay updated on tech news watching their content. I also have been watching cybersecurity channels where they teach people how to use Parrot OS, Kali Linux and the tools that come with it. It is from these people that I got introduced to home labs and servers.
