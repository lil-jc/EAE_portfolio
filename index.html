        Welcome to my webpage! My name is Lin Yuli, my teachers and friends know me as Jacob. Since young I have wanted to pursue computer science and have been passionate about it. I started exploring and expanding my knowledge in IT during secondary 2. That was when it all started, I started by building my PC and then continued to learn programming and later discovered cybersecurity. My journey in IT has been fun and enjoyable. I have consolidated my achievements and progress in this web page portfolio. Enjoy!
