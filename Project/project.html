            I had my first project in secondary 2 where I built my first computer. At that time I needed a computer for my school projects and I also wanted to try out PC gaming (which later I disliked). This computer had me researching for months and after many PC building tutorials, I went to get my parts and started building it. I was lucky that I bought the parts then when it is cheaper compared to now where pc components are really inflated. The specs of the PC are:

                Recently I helped my cousin build a computer for his start-up. He needed a high performance computer to run forex market simulation for a bot his company is developing on. As I had been eager to contribute to his company, I took the opportunity to help him build the computer. Since I had experience building computers before, building another one again is much simpler and straightforward. I completed the task within a day. The pc had to be water cooled for the best performance as the CPU (intel i9 12th gen 12900k) is known for producing an extensive amount of heat. The specifications of the PC are:

            This is my home lab or home server. In order to explore more into the world or IT I decided to have a server at home. I understand that a server is just a computer so I bought a second hand computer off Carousell and made it my Server. When I just bought the computer it was running Windows 7. It is extremely slow and laggy so I cleared the disk and installed the ubuntu server on it. Immediately, the computer is usable again. My version on Ubuntu server only has a command line interface. Since I had previously been using the linux command line in CS50, I am not very affected by the difference in user interface on the computer. I access the computer through SSH to keep my place organised. My friend, a NUS graduate, had been helping me understand more about servers, web hosting and networking after I got my server.        </P>

            This is my raspberry pi 4. I bought it so that I could explore more into computers and their OS without needing to worry about destroying the computer. The raspberry piâ€™s operating system is loaded on a SD card and the computer will boot from it. I can explore all I want on the raspberry pi and worst comes to worst,  can just flash another os on the SD card and start over. Later on I discovered PIVPN and decided to make it a part of my home lab as a VPN for its low power consumption. With a VPN I can access my server practically anywhere that I have an internet connection and also be able to access my local network overseas when travelling.        </p>
